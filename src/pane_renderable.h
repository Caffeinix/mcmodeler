/**
  * Subclass of RectangularPrismRenderable used for drawing panes, like glass panes or iron bars.  Panes actually have
  * fairly little resemblance to rectangular prisms, but they can be constructed out of multiple rectangular prisms in
  * various orientations, so we subclass RectangularPrismRenderable mainly to get its texture coordinate mapping code.
  *
  * To support the myriad different possible orientations of panes, we define a grand total of five different prisms:
  *
  *   * A full-width pane running north-south,
  *   * A half-width pane on the north side of the block,
  *   * A half-width pane on the east side of the block,
  *   * A half-width pane on the south side of the block,
  *   * A half-width pane on the west side of the block.
  *
  * This allows us to construct almost every necessary orientation (including all four corner orientations) by merely
  * hiding or showing certain quads when we render.  The sole exception is a full-width east-west pane, which is
  * rendered by simply rotating the north-south pane before we render it.
  *
  * @todo Arguably, composition would be more appropriate than inheritance for this class.
