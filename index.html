<p>MCModeler is a Minecraft modeling tool that combines the ease of level-based, top-down 2D editing with the ability to preview your creations in true 3D.</p>

<h2>Dire Warnings</h2>

<p><span style="color: #933">MCModeler is not yet ready for prime time.</span>  It is made available for download in its current state mainly for developers and technically savvy users who enjoy living on the bleeding edge.  It has many, many missing features (undo support, rectangle and circle tools), many missing blocks (panes and bars, torches, saplings and flowers, etc.), and probably many bugs.  The save format is likely to change before release, so your creations may be lost or corrupted at some point in the future.  In short, you should download this to play around with it or help write it, <em>not</em> to get serious work done with it.  You have been warned.</p>

<h2>Message to Developers</h2>

<p>I am actively looking for developers to help me work on MCModeler.  If you're interested, please take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Caffeinix/mcmodeler/wiki/Development">the Development page on the wiki</a> and grab the source code for yourself.  At the time of this writing, MCModeler is very well documented, so finding your way around should be pretty easy.  <strong style="color:black">If you are fluent in OpenGL, I especially need your help</strong> &mdash; my attempts at 3D graphics programming are pretty n00b-ish.</p>
